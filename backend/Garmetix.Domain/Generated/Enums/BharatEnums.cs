 * This file contains all the Enums used in Garmetix. Enums are used to define a set of named constants that can be used throughout the application.
 * This file is included in all platforms, so any changes made here will be reflected in all platforms.
 * Enums are used to improve code readability and maintainability by providing meaningful names for constant values.
 * Enums can also be used to enforce type safety and prevent invalid values from being assigned to variables.
 * Enums can be used in switch statements, if statements, and other control flow structures to make the code more readable and easier to understand.
 * Enums can also be used in data models, view models, and other classes to represent specific states or categories of data.
 * Enums can be defined with specific underlying types (e.g., int, byte) to optimize memory usage and performance.
 * Enums can also have associated methods and properties to provide additional functionality.
 * Overall, enums are a powerful tool for improving code quality and maintainability in Garmetix.
